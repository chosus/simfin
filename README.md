Finding Winners in the Public Markets using Historical Financials

Investors usually look into the past to forecast future results. While this might seem reasonable at first, weighing too heavily on past results eliminates opportunities to make outsized returns in the markets.

"You can't predict the future through a rearview mirror" - Peter Lynch

What I have found to be extremely useful is combining a quantitative approach on historical data with deep fundamental research. This analysis/model acts as an effective screener but requires an extra step of building domain knowledge and digging into company strategy, management, and industry to solidify one's conviction.

Using historical financial statement data, I give companies a weighted average score out 10 based on Value, Quality, Growth, Margin Improvement, and Balance Sheet. The scores show me which companies have been doing well (high score) and which companies are struggling (low score).

Many companies with low scores are left for dead and may be trading at below their intrinsic value, which is why it is important to add an extra step of deep fundamental research and valuation. Conversely, companies with high scores may be trading above and beyond their intrinsic value and investors should tread carefully.
